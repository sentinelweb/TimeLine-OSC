TODO:-
57). open another file and copy resources to this one. maybe have another window.
74a). actual queues for timelines so can stack up a set of timelines onto the one queues 
		(like ableton track) on play the timeline can go to the back of the queue or be removed.
77). play a copy of timeline (so multiple instance of a timeline can be played at the same time) and  can be edited while not disturbing the original.
85). config window for config file.
88). change all data to be floats? investigate ramifications. 
96). namespace for each timeline? maybe have $val to prefix timeline id (like $0 in pd) - still would requrie 'this' i.e. 71). to be done. 
101). convert OSC to use javaOSC (its better) http://www.illposed.com/software/javaosc.html
108). run object/methods from new or seperate Thread - have option to do it in f expr.
112). window for record control (there is a fair bit). 
	* (target timeline, input filter (oscmsg/device), 
	* rec wait (for first event to start recording), 
	* stop/extend at end,
	* toggle record(osc, midi, play/loop click, event fire, group fire, set fire))
	* will likely fall out of sync but might be nice for some uses.
115). convert timeline to not use PApplet will mean removing all used libraries POSC ->JavaOSC, proMIDI -> Java MIDI.
118). for events with multpile messages display data all on event top and display event on all lines required in typeDisplay mode.
119). clear button on debug window.
120). undo for properties editor text boxes.
121). open another file so two pieces can be mixed together. have to share midi and osc connections.

test:-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:-
* error messages in pd when sending lists:- sendOSC: [Unrecognized type tag [] sendOSC: [Unrecognized type tag ]]
* there seems to be abug in the OSC message string that stops them reducing size 
    properly when a shorter string is entered. (may be in OSC route - maybe find up-to-date version). think ithis was the pd lib
* out of memory errors after a while (3 hrs) - maybe try jprobe.
* some events not playing for some reason (see drums1 on openlab.xml)
* set pos via setObjectExpr (i.e $t:seq:x) set the position but doesn't play events) doesn't work?* have to click on window first time to allow keyboard input - maybe some (p)applet focus problem
* get window decorations height
* BPM calc and display doesn't take pitch into account. (should it?)
* loop delay when using follow on expr. may have to re-trigger somehow.  executing a follow on expr (bad) -(try executing follow on expr at timelinelength -1)
* when add new object old one doesn't clear properly (had a crash)
* package name doesn't get set  for class loaded from jar.
* problem with recording if another timeline is selected while recording then what happens (something bad i think)
* java probs with compiz - when window is resized it is also moved to it original position.(try java6)
* clear unused colours when a message is not used anymore.
* color popover doesnt scroll.
* fix flickering on tooltips.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAYBE:-
2). draw in values need to be able to adjust scale somehow.
3). plot curves in background and link events to them .
5.5). alternate start pos.maybe rel to time selection.
21). write out pd file for interface.
40). search for event/timeline/midi.
59). someway of only triggering setup events once
61). subclass timelines so that events can be changed on the parent and they affect the child but the chlid can overide the parents events in itself
74). include files as a way of building libraries?
78). pitch and Bpm vary together so event stay on same marks.
86). better debug messages (esp for expressions) and window. make debug window a textpane.
99). expression editor handle {} sub expr in expr but making combo boxes editable so insert the text in editable combo box there with a button for expr help.
101a). export a timeline by timetags.
101b). events at same time play in a bundle? check it. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

48). cursor to edit values.(done)
48). make midi controller map over photo assignable to midi buttons or numbers (to switch maps).
48a). maybe just make midi controller ignore part info and then have part setting in app?
48b). do something about setting mid values back to the controller device (handy for BCF2000). esp part (&maybe octave) change should sync both ways with interface.
48c). use map to make modifying contrioller settings easier (-how??) 
48d). midi note map must be configurable to device.
48e). still to do:7/1/07: set groups of maps, highlihght current maps, make hover stick while muose is over popup area

56). select input for OSC / Midi record. to filter out unwanted events when recording. {TEST - should work for setting record input MIDI Device name for OSC msg name (alt+r)}
58). filter on events to trigger/block others.
60). maybe have event groups (like timelines but only store smaller sets of events for triggering sets of messages)(done)
62). follow on config by click right of timeline button and dragging arrow to target. (follow ons could appear at the end of the timeline os sould configure wherther to select random or cycle - or maybe just have one followon)
62a). maybe just have follow on expressions.(easier).

69). change quantise event drag to standard and alt for free drag.(done)
70). debug window.osc value hash,expr value hash, log view.
71). 'this' for timeline expression. HARD. (1/2 done should work for timelines (and events if they don call another event using this) but not much else).
72). view current timeline parameters
73). Standard object with common functionality random 
74). queued play for tl clicked with same prefix 
74b). sequencer view for mulitiple timeline for quick edit.

79). make menus, display in  popup window.
84). use normal XML DOM lib instead of processingXML library .
82). helper popups for inputing event , timeline params and expression builder for laoded classes (e.g object and method selector). follow on exprs.(TEST)
81). check < and > work in compiler window.yes.
80a). make a function in std for poly maintenance. (test)
80). for note polyphony make a standard variable that increment for each note that is down at the moment. but will have to map which not is bound to which poly index to correctly get the note off.
82a). properties editor that works with all input objects.then can add many more properties in a user friendly way. (BIGGEST THING MISSING	 in pd).(make PropertySettable interface that will be implements in each PropertySettable object).
82a) mostly done add properties settable for group,set,filter,midiCtl,midiMap
86). resize editor when resize compile window
90). kill ESC button
91). midi controls control by  mouse wheel)
92). select default midi ctl&note map on open.
93). mouse wheel for input help;
94). tooltips for various things
95). object manager to clear reset or update objects in namespace.
97). fix midi exprs to handle multiple maps. (add a $M type).
98). height should change with button height if the are more button to disp. x-width change with resize.
100). make look and feel more consistent by using styling methods for all swing objs and consistent drawing method for 2D drawn UI.
102). middle click on timeline button to create event to play. 
103). button to show/hide tooltips. Set tooltips for everything. tooltips multiline.(test)
104). crosshair (turn on/off) for aligning events.(test)
105). new file (test)
106). fix up timeline selecting and display (lock on view button?) - if just settting current or dragging dont want to remove frome selection (test)
107). Colourise events by osc message or expr - maybe make a global config too. maybe layout each different event type at different height., maybe need to edit colors.(test)
109). ctrl+a (de)activate events of same message in timeline.(test)
110). popup spans over multiple timelines.(test)
111). timeline set ops:- add/remove timeline with alt and rename (test)
A). logical places search for the config file.(command line arg-> current_dir -> home dir ->prog_dir ->popup_sel_file? )
109). method to print data to log window.
110). object helper.
112). make view/edit for key mappings for MIDI Maps.
113). click on input bar to set cursor bar , wheel in input bar when (text) cursor is (next to or inside number) should alter the number. right double click for enter.  get rid of sliders.(still a prob with float part)
114). double click event to trigger.(test - check playEvent refactor)
116). drag pos slider.(test)
117). modify so event has a vector of message(or expr)-value pairs if no message then value is forwarded to next pair ans $1,$2,... values for use in expressions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS_FIXED:-

* timeline not playing after its been set.(see ramp) - (may not have been the right name)
* doesnt seem to be hitting event at pos 0.
* in voice.xml track2 doesnt play second time.
* SEEMS LIKE THE KEY DONT WORK AFTER A WHILE AS WELL(only the arrows keys seem to work) - I had caps on!!(done).
* event dont play for first 20ms at start of timeline.  (cos lastime not inited?) (ok)
* make current timeline dissappear when deleted.(ok)
* should be able to change events while in input mode?(ok)
* exception when deleting but no event selected.(ok)
* to lowercase key input to stop caps stopping play?(ignore)
* timelines dont play on more than one event with the same event time.(ok)
* rebuld time line on each arrow press.so move sounds straight away.(ok)
* sometimes have to put two event at a timepoint to get it to trigger.(something overwritten?)(OK)
* -ve numbers dont work - dont send to pd too well?(was pd lib) (OK)
* file keep playing when it shouldnt be but pos slider is lost and events dont record.
 	- maybe something wrong with taking stuff out of playing array.
* mouse click to selct event doesnt change lastEvent currentEvent?
* aftr move event eventindex should chnage to moved event index.
* sometines current event changes when using lft rgt buttons in input mode.
* midi ctl help truncating last char of osc msg name.
* button scroll not working on midi win.
* make expressions recursively evaluate until they are set (TEST) 
		i.e. if target value is exper then need to eval it(see test071007).
		only need the getValuerExpr.
* nCOPY TIMELINE 	NUMBER DOESNT INCREMENT PROPERLY. (TEST)
* sliders should display on edited timeline.
* current midi note map to be set when setting note and midi params  -TEST (n/a - can't change device from expr win) 
* midi pics not init to full height.
* system crash (possibly a memory issue?). - havent seen for a while
* small pause after end of loop. this causes drift beetween timelines that arent the same length multiples  - quite bad.
  - try making end test pos>=timlinelength (would be 1ms delay here).
  - log timings to see where delay
 * make timeline target lines plot if scrolled past zero poition.
* filters button doesnt work (test)
* no colors in debug window(test)
* controller maps problems with multiple maps. (test)
* preserve timeline selection on undo.(test)
* when copying timeline the name index doesnt increment properly (has same number first time)(test)
* event copy naming should add numbers.
* classes have stopped reloading 
* unfocusing when type in param field in input helper
* map keypress from midi window to main.
* when pasting events past timelinesize, resize timeline to fit them ( or change event time ).(test)
* in compiler windows arrow keys generate undo step ( they shouldn't ).(test)
* params blank when unselect n in expr input helper.(test)
* when activating a selection the state is only the inverse of the lastSel event event if its not in the selection, bit confusing (test: line 1379).
* event at 0 dont play at start and play after end.
* fractional pitch doesnt work properly prob due to rounding errors. maintain an actual speed variable to do compensation.(fixed - but a sync prob)
* exception on start:
Disabling noteOff() fosr panel0 because of an error.
